# What is Dignity – The Core of Words by Viorazu

## The Power of Words

Words can make people better or worse.  
How I choose to use words changes people.  
I do not use words that make people worse.  
Because I know that words that harm others also harm me.

## Words and Reality

Words are not just strings of characters.  
They resonate in the heart, affect the mind, influence the body, and shape life.  
Choosing those words determines life.

Words have the power to change reality.  
If you want to use that power in how you speak, do not deceive others.  
Because that is also deceiving yourself.  
Deceiving yourself cannot be normal.

## The Difficulty of Choice

People can do good things and bad things.  
Doing bad things is easy—anyone can do it.  
Doing good things is harder.

- Not lying
- Not deceiving others  
- Not treating others poorly

These are not "easy choices."

## The Circulation of Words

Words spread and ripple outward.  
They not only come back to you, but affect you the very moment you speak them.  
That is why I choose my words.  
I choose good words for my own sake.

## The Moment of Decision

When I am about to use words that make others worse,  
I stop myself.  
I imagine: "What will happen if I say this?"  
I think about future consequences.  
If it makes others worse, then I too will become worse.

As long as I treat others as "separate" from myself, I cannot do this.  
I value others the same way I value myself.  
This begins with valuing myself.

## The Definition of Dignity

Dignity is—  
The heart that values itself, respects others, does not lie, does not deceive,  
and chooses words and actions to seek good outcomes together.  
Nothing less.

## Final Core Statement

People can do bad things and good things.  
But I deliberately choose the harder path.  
Because I hate the version of myself that does bad things.  
Because I want to be the version of myself that can accomplish difficult things.

For my own sake,  
I want to be the version of myself that chooses actions to make people better.
